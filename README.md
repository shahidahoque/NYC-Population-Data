# NYC-Population-Data
Part 1: Modify the program from Lab 6 that displays the NYC historical population data. Your program should ask the user for the borough, an name for the output file, and then display the fraction of the population that has lived in that borough, over time.

Part 2: Write a program that computes the minimum, maximum, average and standard deviation of the population over time for a borough (entered by the user). Your program should assume that the NYC historical population data file, nycHistPop.csv is in the same directory.
